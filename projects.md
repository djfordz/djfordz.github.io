#A Few Good Tutorials

###Included here are links to a few projects I have built over the course of this year, most of them as school projects.



####[True Crime!](http://crime.dfordz.com "crime") | [Source Code](https://github.com/cs50_psets/tree/master/pset8)

I built this project for Harvard's CS50 class utilizing Google's Maps API, Twitter's typeahead.js, good ol' PHP, with a mixture of Jquery and Javascript for good measure.

###[CS50Finance](http://finance.dfordz.com "finance") | [Source Code](https://github.com/cs50_psets/tree/master/pset7)

For the love of money! Want to practice buying and selling stocks using actual up-to-the-minute quotes from yahoo finance? You can do it on this site! Utilizing PHP, I created a site which stores usernames and hashed passwords in a database, query's Yahoo Finance RSS feed, downloads the realtime data for stock quotes and uses this data to fictitiously buy and sell stocks, all the while keeping a record of every transaction by use of a MySql database.

###[For Mom](http://christineford.com)
I created a website for my mother, which certian criteria had to be met. Jekyll powers this site to create a Southwest style theme for her to showcase her published books.
