<h2 class="post-title">Here are a few of my projects I am working on, from rather simple to a bit more complex.</h2>

<h3>Many of these are projects I have done for tutorials, university classes (such as Harvard's CS50), and for fun.</h3>
<p><small>note: if you want to see my answers to <a href="http://projecteuler.net">ProjectEuler's</a> questions I will make them available to you as I do them in my spare time.</small></p>

<li><a href="http://djfordz.github.io/google-homepage"><strong>Recreate Google Search Page</strong></a> | <a href="https://github.com/djfordz/google-homepage">Source code hosted on Github</a>

<p>The first project showcased here is a simple Google Search Page Rendition from <a href="http://theodinproject.com" target="_blank">The Odin Project's Web Developer 101</a> course. </p>
<p> If you look at the source code, the first thing you will notice, setting my page apart from my colleagues, is instead of using images, I went ahead and rendered a font which is better for SEO and better shows my knowledge of CSS trickery. I also went ahead and used FontAwesome to render the icons in the upper left corner and used a Gravatar for the image.</p>

<li><a href="http://djfordz.github.io/project_js_jquery"><strong>Simple Etch-a-Sketch</strong></a> | <a href="https://github.com/djfordz/project_js_jquery">Source code hosted on Github</a>
<p>This is a simple page to show off my Javascript skills.  Again from <a href="http://theodinproject.com" target="_blank">The Odin Project</a>.</p>
<p>I didn't spend much time on the looks of the page (as it obviously shows) however, that was not the project's intent, if you look at my .js code you will see the difference again, separating me from my colleagues in the same course.</p> 
<p>I used OOP programming principles with functions and method callbacks, and although we could use jQuery which everyone used except myself, I figured I would challenge myself by coding in pure JS.</p>

<p>A simple personal author site for a Children's Book Writer, it encompasses a Southwest theme and the site owner's personal style.  The site uses the Jekyll framework and the liquid templating engine, making it relatively easy to produce a static site.</p>
