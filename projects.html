<h2 class="post-title">Here are a few of my projects I am working on, from rather simple to a bit more complex.</h2>

<h3>Many of these are projects I have done for tutorials, university classes (such as Harvard's CS50), and for fun.</h3>
<p><small>note: if you want to see my answers to <a href="http://projecteuler.net">ProjectEuler's</a> questions I will make them available to you as I do them in my spare time.</small></p>

<li><a href="http://finance.dfordz.com"><strong>C$50Finance for Harvard CS50X</strong></a> | <a href="https://github.com/djfordz/cs50finance">Source code hosted on Github</a>

<p>This simple project requires the use of PHP to make SQL queries as well as download CSV Data from an RSS Feed, specifically from Yahoo Finance.  It showcases knowledge of PHP and MySql as well as authentiction with a server and cookie storage.</p>

<li><a href="http://crime.dfordz.com/"><strong>Mashups - Utilizing Google Maps API, Google News RSS, Database Queries and Crime database API.</strong></a> | <a href="https://github.com/djfordz/mashups">Source code hosted on Github.</a>

<p>This project is a bit more complex using Javascript, Google Maps API, along with Jquery and Twitters typeahead framework to create a map with specific points on it which, when clicked will make an info window pop up with links to specific news sources related to that specific area shown on the map as well as current crime data showed around the map.  It utilizes PHP to get news feeds from Google's News Service as well as Javascript and Jquery to intialize the API calls for google maps and the Crime database.  It also institutes Twitter's typeahead.js to complete search queries ahead of time which then calls a database where all the postal codes along with latitude and longitude are stored in the United States.</p>

<li><a href="http://djfordz.github.io/google-homepage"><strong>Recreate Google Search Page</strong></a> | <a href="https://github.com/djfordz/google-homepage">Source code hosted on Github</a>

<p>This project simply recreates Google's famous search page, it isn't functional, although as an added bonus I may revisit and make it an actual functional search page.  From <a href="http://theodinproject.com" target="_blank">The Odin Project's Web Developer 101</a> course. </p>

<p> If you look at the source code, the first thing you will notice, setting my page apart from my colleagues, is instead of using images, I went ahead and rendered a font which is better for SEO and better shows my knowledge of CSS trickery. I also went ahead and used FontAwesome to render the icons in the upper left corner and used a Gravatar for the image.</p>

<li><a href="http://djfordz.github.io/project_js_jquery"><strong>Simple Etch-a-Sketch</strong></a> | <a href="https://github.com/djfordz/project_js_jquery">Source code hosted on Github</a>
<p>This is a simple page to show off my Javascript skills.  Again from <a href="http://theodinproject.com" target="_blank">The Odin Project</a>.</p>
<p>I didn't spend much time on the looks of the page (as it obviously shows) however, that was not the project's intent, if you look at my .js code you will see the difference again, separating me from my colleagues in the same course.</p> 
<p>I used OOP programming principles with functions and method callbacks, and although we could use jQuery which everyone used except myself, I figured I would challenge myself by coding in pure JS.</p>

<li><a href="http://christineford.org"><strong>Christineford.org</strong></a>
<p>A simple personal author site for a Children's Book Writer, it encompasses a Southwest theme and the site owner's personal style.  The site uses the Jekyll framework and the liquid templating engine, making it relatively easy to produce a static site.</p>
