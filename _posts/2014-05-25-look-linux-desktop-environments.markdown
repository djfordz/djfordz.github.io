<p>[su_heading size="22" align="left"]Xfce4 is still the best -- and here is why >>[&#47;su_heading]</p>
<p>Nearly all who have made the switch from Microsoft Windows to a Linux-based PC start off with an Ubuntu flavored distribution.  The reasons are many, however I can honestly say this is mostly due to the hyperbole surrounding the distro.  Although the ease of installation and use, overwhelming support, and noob friendly help forum doesn't hurt either.  However, since Ubuntu switched to the Unity <abbr title="Desktop Environment">DE<&#47;abbr> starting with version 13.04, there has been a massive migration of followers who went in search of a replacement distro.  I was one of them.  My reasons were the same as many others--Unity became too resource heavy, bugs were abundant, and it was simply too frustrating to get anything worthwhile done using the <abbr title="Desktop Environment">DE<&#47;abbr>.  So, the search was on.  Over the course of the next year I tried many, many distributions and flavors of Linux.  Debian, OpenSuse, and the like.  Then I stumbled upon <a href="http:&#47;&#47;archlinux.org" title="The Arch Way">Arch Linux<&#47;a>.  At first glance it looked a bit too foreboding for my noob abilities, but want for a challenge I dove into learning how to install this seemingly amazing distro.  I have never looked back since.  Arch Linux has renewed my faith in Linux and the Open Source agenda.  But finding the right distro was only half the battle.</p>
<h3>Enter into the search for the right Desktop Environment<&#47;h3></p>
<p>I went through just about all of them, Cinnamon, Mate, Gnome, Kde, the list goes on and on.  I used each one for a few months, but never could really get comfortable with any of them, they were always missing something.  Everytime I would always end up going back to Xfce4.  Now these guys got it right.  Xfce4 is not as resource heavy as most of the others, the functionality is just...perfect.  It truly is a brilliant <abbr title="Desktop Environment">DE<&#47;abbr> and the best one as far as I'm concerned.  Easily configurable, it has all the right functionality in the right places, it does not try to be Windows, or Mac, or wizzbang golly gee, it is simple, down to earth, and does everything just right.  I love Xfce4.</p>
<h3>Everyone needs to go on the journey to find the right Linux Desktop Environment for themselves.<&#47;h3></p>
<p>Just because Xfce4 is a perfect match for me, obviously does not mean it is a perfect match for everyone.  I encourage everyone to go on a search for their perfect fit.  Not only does one gain the experience of many different varieties and flavors of Linux, but one also learns the intricacies of the Linux operating system.  Yes, I would consider myself still a noob, but the knowledge I have gained switching to the Archway has made me a dangerously powerful noob.  I am sure by the end of my journey of becoming a Guru, I will end up with a simple Windows Manager like Openbox, or Fluxbox, but for now Xfce4 has become my de facto desktop environment and I doubt I will ever change again.</p>
<h3>The Arch Way<&#47;h3></p>
<p>I feel Linux users are a bit more curious, intelligent, and thoughtful than most of the general public, I mean this is why we make the switch right?  Linux is amazing, to have so many options, so many different ways of doing things, and so much power, all for free, shows the dedication of Linux developers and the dedication of all of us learning code.</p>
<h2>Linux Forever..Amen.<&#47;h2></p>
