##The Knowledge Exchange
I have started this site to showcase my projects, keep my notes in order, explain different things I have learned, and start a collection of answers.  More for my aging brain than anything else, however hopefully these resources may become helpful to others as well.

This is just a little blurb to get the ball rolling.  From here on out, all the articles will be technical in nature and the collection of cheatsheets, programs, snippets, tweaks, and tricks will start to rapidly develop...(in theory anyhow)
Awesome, huh?!
elcome to my little corner of interspace.  I hope you found something useful.
