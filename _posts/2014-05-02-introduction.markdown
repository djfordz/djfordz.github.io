##The Knowledge Exchange

I have started this site as a fun little hobby, erm..side-project using the most awesome [Jekyll Templating Engine](http://jekyllrb.com "Jekyll"), Seriously, Jekyll is awesome! check it out when you get a chance...of course it goes without saying, hosting a 'freebie' on [Github](http://github.com "Github"), again another awesome project, who btw, uses Jekyll...so together they are simply unbeatable...just posh your projects and it builds them for you...sweet!

So back to the purpose of my site. Its main purpose is simply to allow for an ever-so-slight web presence, highlighting my foray into the Computer Sciences whilst showcasing a few of my contributions to the world, however so slight they may be at the moment.  I am hoping to grow this site into am Open Source Projects Power House! (with notes).

####Again, I hope you find something useful while you are here!
