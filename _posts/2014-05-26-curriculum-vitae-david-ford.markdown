<p>As much as I love learning to code the web in my spare time, I feel I need some direction and a constant stream of work to be able to continually improve my skills and learn at an accelerated pace.</p>
<p>I am currently working on an online resume, feel free to take a look and let me know what you think. [su_lightbox src="http:&#47;&#47;davidford.cerebralmess.com"]<a href="#" alt="Curriculum_Vitae" title="Check it out">Curriculum Vitae for David Ford<&#47;a>[&#47;su_lightbox].</p>
