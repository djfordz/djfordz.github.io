## From the beginning
If you are like me, you have worked hard your entire life in a profession that hasn't really suited your abilities, your intelligence, or your personality.  You made a few choices in life that didn't necessarily bring your profession in line with your passion.  For quite a while you have been wanting to figure out a way to switch gears and head in a direction which is more aligned with your imagination, to make a living out of what you do every day for fun.  For me it is coding.  Everyday I do it for free, and I love doing it, then I used to go to work at a job that was not even remotely close to having anything to do with coding or computers or my passion.  This all changed for me about a year and a half ago.  I decided I was going to do what I loved, and I was not going to let anything stand in my way.  What had started as a hobby, turned passion, finally turned profession.  Here is how I did it.  The short version, because I spent a lot of time going around in circles.  I am going to try to lessen that pain for you.

## Decide if this is really what you want to do.

Nothing is worse than deciding to enter a profession, spend the time and resources learning a trade, then finding out you really don't like it, at all....
This happened to me when I decided to become an aircraft mechanic.  It was a decent job, I just really hated it.  I have always spent time building websites, keeping abreast of tech, and dabbling in code, but never truly dove into it with a desire to do it professionally.  It was a dream, but never one I thought would come true.  With this said, be careful in believing in the hype.  You will not make a million dollars your first year.  You will most likely not have a Unicorn the very first site you build.  You probably won't even make over fifteen dollars an hour at your first job.  If you really do not like spending hours coding just for the fun of it, most likely you will not succeed in this profession. **Don't Fall For The Hype!** If you do not absolutely love figuring out puzzles, enjoy spending hours staring at the computer screen thinking intensely of ways to make something to work. If you can't handle failure, or people constantly being a heck of a lot smarter than you, or if you can' handle pure and utter destruction of the ego then this business is probably not for you. On the other hand, the reward for hard work, intense thinking, thousands of hours of practice, constant study, is an intense sense of accomplishment and a transcendental feeling of well-being when something which seemed impossible is accomplished. That feeling alone is addictive.  Coding and development isn't for everyone, even though everyone thinks it is.  Let me be the first to tell you developing professionally, with deadlines, bosses, accountability is completely different than doing it as a hobby.  So you better really think about it, and really really like doing it, if you plan on doing it  professionally. 

Now off the soapbox, one good resource that breaks down and describes a web development career is 

[The Odin Project](http://theodinproject.com).  

Give it a read and do the Web Development 101 course, this will give you a good idea of whether you are in it for the long haul.  I constantly hear people griping and complaining in forums, "I really like doing this kind of stuff, I just need motivation, or someone to push me." if that is the case, you don't really like doing this stuff, your doing it because you think it pays big bucks. Well it does if you are really really good at it, it doesn't just starting out, so be prepared for minimum wage, and consider yourself lucky if you get an hourly wage in the teens.

Do this curriculum from beginning to end and you shouldn't have any issues starting out in this field.
