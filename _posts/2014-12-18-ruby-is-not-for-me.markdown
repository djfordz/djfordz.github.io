##Spanish--Not My Style

Fifteen years ago, I was just entering into my Sophomore year of high school, during this time, I had a critical decision to make.  A decision which could make a definitive impact on the future of my marketability. The decision of course was which foreign language to take.  Now, during this time, I wasn't too concerned about my future, but seeing it was also a graduation requirement, it was a choice which had to be made.  As I sat in my councilor's office categorically letting her latest spiel about successful career guidance casually slip through my thought stream, with a discerning disregard for such things, the importance and fundamental necessity of learning Spanish received about as much attention. Albeit, even though my attention to her words was indistinguishable of that of a gnat's, I did agree with her on the need for Spanish, and decided to take it. What I did not expect was my very disturbing aversion to the language. Over the years I have oft thought how much easier it would have been for me to convey my needs to a burgeoning ethnic minority of the United States.  She was definitely correct in her assessment; Spanish would have been the most marketable language I could have learned, many of my friends did just this, and have benefited since. However, for me it couldn't be as easy, I simply hate Spanish.  I have no idea why this animosity exists, nor why it encompasses nearly all the romance languages, but I do, I have a serious revulsion to them.  My Junior year I decided to take Russian instead, and not only did I do remarkably well with Russian, I truly enjoyed learning and speaking it.  I had an amazing affinity and almost gravitational pull to the Slavic languages. My fascination and interest in Slavic languages was easily transfered to Japanese when I was residing in Okinawa, I effortlessly picked Japanese up fairly readily. So how come Spanish was so difficult? I not know the answer to this question, but I do know I do not want to learn it, nor speak it.  This went for all the Latin based romance languages.  I took a French class my Senior and had the same problems I had in Spanish.

###The Romance Just Isn't There

So, what does this have to do with Ruby?  As I have been progressing through different educational and tutorial programs, I have found similar issues with programming languages, There are those which I definitely love to learn and write, and ones I have a serious aversion to; Ruby being in the latter category and C being in the former.  Honestly, I do not know what the psychology behind this pseudo-phobic pretentiousness, but I do know that there are certain languages that I have an easier time grasping and a happier time writing than others.  I want to learn Ruby, I want to learn Python, however I hate the syntax of both.  I find this sort of interesting as both Ruby and Python have been alluded to as being the romance languages of the programming world.  Both are very popular up-and-coming languages which learning them would definitely be a positive move career-wise. Yet, I simply cannot seem to get any satisfaction, or even that excited about using either language.  But I love Java, C, Javascript, and PHP, so what gives? Why do I have the same aversions to these languages as I do to similar spoken ones?

###The need to focus

Since I am just beginning my journey into computer science, and more so with web development, I have decided to forgo Ruby at this time, in order to concentrate on PHP, SQL, Javascript and Java.

###Java, my true love..

Java? well that doesn't fit too well with the others, what's up with that?  Let me tell you.  I recently had to help my brother with his Java homework, and immediately fell in love with the language.  I like it plenty better than C, and I really like C.  I enjoy Javascript and PHP as well, since these are the foundational languages of web programing, it would definitely make sense to learn them. 

So their you have it, my list of languages I am in the process of mastering.  I do not know why this aversion exists, or why it transcends both spoken and programmatic languages, but it is there and it is real.  I have found I do better with things which I find interesting and fun, thus I am following my heart once again and not my wallet, once again.......
