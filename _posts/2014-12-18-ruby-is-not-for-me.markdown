##Ruby--Not My Style

Fifteen years ago, I was just entering into my Sophomore year of high school, during registration I had to make a critical choice which could, and would, make a definitive impact on my future marketability in nearly any career path I would take.  At this time, I did not care too much about my future career movements, at least as much as I should have been, however it was also a graduation requirement, thus, this choice wouldn' only affect my future, but my present as well.  Everyone who was serious about their future had obviously had the choice already made for them, as I sat their in my counselors office, being told how important Spanish would be for career development in the coming years, it was in fact necessary for the most part, given the United States' ethnic diversity.  She was definitely correct in her assessment; Spanish would have been the most marketable language I could have learned, or attempted to learn, and many of my friends did just this, which they use quite voraciously in their careers.  However, for me, there was one huge problem, I hated Spanish.  I have no idea why I have this animosity towards Spanish, or any of the romance languages for that matter, but I do.  I have an aversion to them, upon my counselor's request I did take Spanish and French as well, I could not stand either one and fell quite short with making the effort to succeed with either one of these languages.  My Junior year I decided to take a language I was interested in, Russian, and not only did I do remarkably well with it, I truly enjoyed learning it and speaking it.  I really had an amazing affinity and almost gravitational pull to the Slavic languages.  When I was in Japan, I really liked speaking Japanese as well and picked that up fairly easily as well, but Spanish? I just could not, and did not want to learn it, nor speak it.  This went for all the Latin based romance languages.

###The Romance Just Isn't There

So, what does this have to do with Ruby?  As I have been progressing through different educational and tutorial programs, I have found their are programming languages I definitely love to write, and ones I have a serious aversion to, Ruby being in the latter and C being in the former.  Honestly, I do not know what the psychology behind this pseudo-phobic pretentiousness, but I do know that there are certain languages that I have an easier time grasping and a happier time writing than others.  I want to learn Ruby, I want to learn Python, however I hate the syntax of both.  I find this sort of interesting as both Ruby and Python have been alluded to as being like the romance languages of the computer programming world.  Both are very popular up-and-coming languages which would definitely be a positive move career-wise to learn them. Yet, I simply cannot seem to get any satisfaction, or even that excited about using either language.  But I love Java, C, Javascript, and PHP, so what gives? Why do I have the same aversions to these languages as I do to spoken ones?

###The need to focus

Since I am just beginning my journey into computer science, and more so web development, I have decided to forgo Ruby at this time, in order to concentrate on PHP, SQL, Javascript and Java.

###Java, my true love..

Java? well that doesn't fit too well with the others, what's up with that?  Let me tell you.  I recently had to help my brother with his Java programming homework, and fell in love with the language.  I like it plenty better than C, and I really like C.  I enjoy Javascript and PHP as well, since these are the foundational languages of web programing, it would definitely make sense to learn these. 

So this is my list of languages to master.  I do not know why this aversion exists, or why it transcends both spoken and programmatic languages, but it is there and it is real.  I have found I do better with things which I find interesting and fun, thus I am following my heart once again and not my wallet, once again.......
