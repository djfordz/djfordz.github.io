author: David Ford

I have created a fix for Lanot Attachments Magento Extension to use Javascript Uploader instead of Flash based Uploader, this fix is needed after Magento Patch Supee-8788.

You can find the fix on my github at [https://github.com/djfordz/lanot_attachments](https://github.com/djfordz/lanot_attachments)
