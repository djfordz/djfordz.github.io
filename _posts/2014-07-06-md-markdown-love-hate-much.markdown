<p>So, I have been using my own little tidbits of code here and there that I've posted on here, only to realize that Markdown has converted all, yes ALL, the code I have meticulously copied onto this site into escaped characters...So it is pretty much useless untill I go back and and change it.&nbsp; I think I shall be giving markdown a rest fora bit and just insert plain HTML into my documents from here on out, as this has created a lot of work for me to go back and correct...</p>
